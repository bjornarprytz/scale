## Restrictions

Theme: Scale + Unstable
Stipulation: Physical

## Concept

Carry cubes of unstable material to a scale in order to determine their weights
Scales with two platforms to put cubes on

## TODO

  - Cube counter (e.g. 2/20)
  - Instructions

### Nice to have

- Elements behave differently
- Shelves for organizing
- Tab cycles through editable answers
- Shrapnel remains after explosion
- Music
- Make it work on mobile

### Chores

- Setup itch.io page for scale [link](https://itch.io/game/new)
    - Set Kind to HTML
    - Set viewport dimensions (normal: 1152x648)
    - Check SharedArrayBuffer
- Get Butler API key from [itch.io](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys)
- Add key to GitHub secrets as BUTLER_API_KEY [link](https://github.com/bjornarprytz/scale/settings/secrets/actions)
