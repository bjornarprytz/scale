# scale

## Restrictions

Theme: Scale + Unstable
Stipulation: Physical

## Concept

Carry cubes of unstable material to a scale in order to determine their weights
Scales with two platforms to put cubes on

## TODO

- Cube Juice
  - Shrapnel remains after explosion
  - Elements behave differently
  - Tweak the volatility
- Background

### Nice to have

- Make cubes more visually interesting (shader magic?)
- Music
- Make it work on mobile

### Chores

- Get Butler API key from [itch.io](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys)
- Add key to GitHub secrets as BUTLER_API_KEY [link](https://github.com/bjornarprytz/scale/settings/secrets/actions)
