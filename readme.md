# scale

## Restrictions

Theme: Scale + Unstable
Stipulation: Physical

## Concept

Carry cubes of unstable material to a scale in order to determine their weights

4 colors of cubes:

- Green
- Red
- Blue
- Yellow

Scales with two platforms to put cubes on:

- Shows

## TODO

- Upgrade UI
  - Cube spawner
  - Instructions
- Increase difficulty
  - Timer?
  - Volatility
- Game over

### Nice to have

- Elements behave differently
- Conveyer belt with cube count
- Shelves for organizing
- Tab cycles through editable answers
- Enter submits
- Shrapnel remains after explosion
- Music
- Make it work on mobile

### Chores

- Setup itch.io page for scale [link](https://itch.io/game/new)
    - Set Kind to HTML
    - Set viewport dimensions (normal: 1152x648)
    - Check SharedArrayBuffer
- Get Butler API key from [itch.io](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys)
- Add key to GitHub secrets as BUTLER_API_KEY [link](https://github.com/bjornarprytz/scale/settings/secrets/actions)
